a ridiculously minimalistic css framework.

I challenged myself to see how small I could go, but preserve everything Skeleton, Milligram, and other micro frameworks have to offer. 

## Getting Started
1. Download [lit.css](https://github.com/Ajusa/lit/blob/master/lit.css)
2. Include [lit.css](https://github.com/Ajusa/lit/blob/master/lit.css)
